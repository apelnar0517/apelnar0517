Hi, I'm Alex!

I'm a graduate of Northeast Wisconsin Technical College with an Associate's Degree in Software Development.

I've been a professional programmer since August of 2020, working as the sole developer in our team. That means I'm QA, Project Manager, Lead Developer, etc. There, I work with .Net, C#, SQL, and JQuery/Javascript.

I've also contributed to a few other repositories which have made me familiar with PHP, Laravel, and Vue.js.

I'm always looking to learn new programming languages. Currently I'm most interested in learning Python and taking advantage of its Machine Learning capabilities.
